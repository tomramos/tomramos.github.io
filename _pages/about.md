I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Calififornia in Los Angeles (UCLA). I am currently a Research Scientist at [José Luiz Egydio Setúbal Foundation](https://fundacaojles.org.br/en/) in São Paulo, Brazil, and at the [California  Center for Population Research](https://ccpr.ucla.edu/), UCLA. I am also a visiting Professor at the [Brazilian School of Public and Business Administration](https://ebape.fgv.br/en/school), at Getúlio Vargas Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Previously, I was a Research Scientist at the [Department of Biostatistics](https://ph.ucla.edu/departments/biostatistics), [World Policy Analysis](https://ph.ucla.edu/faculty-research/centers-programs/world-policy-analysis-center), both at [Fielding School of Public Health](https://ph.ucla.edu)

My research has been funded by several sources, including the [National Institute of Health](https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/9165149), UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, Getúlio Vargas Foundation, and the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology. It has been published in several major journals, including Social Science and Medicine, PlosOne, and Population Health Metrics.
